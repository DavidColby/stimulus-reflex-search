# README

The code in this repository was written to accompany the StimulusReflex live search guide originally published at [on my blog](https://www.colby.so/posts/live-search-with-rails-and-stimulusreflex) in August of 2021.

This code demonstrates the implementation of a type-as-you-search experience with Ruby on Rails, powered by StimulusReflex.

To run this project locally, clone the code to your development environment, `cd` into the cloned repository and then:

```shell
bundle
rails db:create db:migrate
rails s
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:3000/players](http://localhost:3000/players) in your browser to see the project in action.
